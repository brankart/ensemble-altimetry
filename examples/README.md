# Example of result

The movie 'compare_duacs.mp4' illustrates the ensemble analysis of altimetric observations,
for a subregion of the Atlantic, between January 1 and March 1, 2019.

The left panels show the reference DUACS product,
the middle panels show one member of the sample obtained using the observation constraint only, and
the right panels show one member of the sample obtained using the observation and model constraint together.

The top panels show the abosulute dynamic topography,
the middle panels show the relative vorticity, and
the bottom panels show the material derivative of potential vorticity.

The solution obtained using the observation constraint only (middle panels) can be obtained with the scripts
using the default parameters provided in 'param.ksh'.
The solution obtained using the observation and model constraint together can be obtained with the scripts
by setting dyn_constraint=".TRUE." rather than dyn_constraint=".FALSE." in the default parameters.
